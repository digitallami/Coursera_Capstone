    "I am a business analyst who advises start-ups on business decisions from start up to execution. I have a client- Yahuza Suya- A chain of 24 hour Nigerian-style barbeque stops who have been operating in the United Kingdom, the Middle-East and is considering expansion into North America.\n",
    "Yahuza will like to open a chain in Toronto, capitalising on the population, the rising number of immigrants from Africa (Nigeria in particular) as well as the metropolitan life. In the 2016 Census, 51,800 people identified themselves as Nigerians, with over half living in Ontario. -Wikipedia\n",
    "In addition, Toronto is home to a large population of young, upwardly mobile professionals who are adventurous and willing to try out other cuisines. \n",
    "Yahuza suya places safety and security as the top priority in choosing the location. This is because the business runs for 24 hours and they need to ensure that the staff and customers feel safe. The location should also be a place that gives easy access to people of above-average household income. This is because the products are a bit pricier than the average barbeque round the world. \n",
    "In addition to security and the pricing target, other attractions that will favour their business is footfall from tourists and people who just moved into Toronto and will like a taste of food they are familiar with. This implies that a place that is close to airports, hotels and inns will be a good location. The target ages for this business is people between 25 and 45. This is because millennials and gen Z shoppers can use their social network and influencer lifestyle to increase patronage through word of mouth. \n"

We will also use this data to eliminate some locations.\n",
